	<b>About:</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	This is a chatroom designed to be as stealthy as possible.<br>
	The owner sometimes is on here, they are displayed as "<p class="bruh">Admin</p>" in red text<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	FAQ:<br>
	<br>
	<b>Q:</b> Why does it sometimes say "Somebody has left" instead of their username?<br>
	<b>A:</b> Since the user has left, the code is sometimes unable to find their username.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Q:</b> How do I become a Mod or Admin?<br>
	<b>A:</b> We are currently not offering anymore spaces on our moderation or admin team. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Q:</b> Why can't we have spaces in our usernames?<br>
	<b>A:</b> Spaces in usernames confuse some people, and make it more difficult to filter certain words.<br>
