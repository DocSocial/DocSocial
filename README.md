# DocSocial
Previously Chatthing, DocSocial is a simple chatroom application. 

It is designed to look like a Google Docs page, and appear similar to one in the tabs bar and even in your history.


Domains:

docsocial.tk -- Main version

docsocial.cf -- Master redirect version, to get around internet blocking

docsocial2.ml -- Temporary unblock version, this WILL change. If it gets taken down, docsocial.cf will be changed to redirect to a new domain.

chatthing.rf.gd  -- Old broken version

docs.heliodex.repl.co  -- Deprecated version

[top secret]  -- Testing area






There is also an extension available called 'Chatthing', it is no longer supported, doesn't allow you to choose your username, and doesn't allow the user to exit the chatroom, resulting in "ghost users".
