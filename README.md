# DocSocial
Previously Chatthing, DocSocial is a simple chatroom application. 

It is designed to look like a Google Docs page, and appear similar to one in the tabs bar and even in your history.


Domains:

chatthing.rf.gd  -- Old broken version

docs.heliodex.repl.co  -- Current use version

[top secret]  -- Testing area

docsocial.tk -- Coming soon!


There is also an extension available called 'Chatthing', it is no longer supported, doesn't allow you to choose your username, and doesn't allow the user to exit the chatroom, resulting in "ghost users".
